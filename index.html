        <p>
            Alejandro Ascencio was born in the beautiful city of Guadalajara Jalisco in Mexico. He would spend most of his time teaching English as a second language at elementary and highschool levels. He would spend his holidays at the Puerto Vallarta beach. He lived all his life in Mexico until de the age of 30, then he decided to move to the USA in the quest of the American dream.

            The old legend said that, the only path for a Mexican dude into the US is through the inclement deset, walking several days and nights, avoiding the horrible threats of the wilderness. Alejandro only had to buy a plane ticket to Chicago (by the way, he is an American citizen naturilized by marriege so, no need of visa.)

            Alejandro is currently swithching careers, coming from a succesful teaching background, going into web development attending to virtual classes at University of Wisconsin Lacrosse.
